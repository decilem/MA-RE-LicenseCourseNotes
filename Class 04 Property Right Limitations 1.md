## Government Limitations

### P.E.T.E

#### 1. Police power

* the right of government to regulate private activity if it's in public interest to do so.
* Zoning = governs land use
  * e.g. use(residential, commercial, etc), height, setbacks, visual appearance, lot sizes, parking, open space, density, FARs, etc
  * 3 ways around zoning: 
    1. **on-conforming use**: A legal use that existed prior to the enactment of current zoning ordinances
    2. **variance**: Special permission to do something otherwise forbidden by the zoning rules
    3. **conditional use permits**: Think of this as a limited variance. Conditional use permits (CUPs)
       allow a commercial or residential use
* Building codes = govern how you build
  * Building codes define basic requirements for construction without necessarily prescribing implementation
  * Certificate of Occupancy (C/O) = proves that the property was built up to code and is safe for occupancy

#### 2. Eminent Domain (土地征用权)

* Right of government to force the sale of privately owned property 

#### 3. Taxes

**municipal property taxes**

* Taxes assessed against your property by the town or city (municipality)

* Pay for most of the things the town or city does

* Taxes run with land

  * Towns can foreclose for unpaid taxes
  * Superpriority lien
  * Equitable right of redemption= 1 year from the date of sale

* Taxes are charged on the assessed value of your property

* Taxes are charged in mills ($1 per $1,000)

* Paid quarterly or semi-annually on a fiscal year running from July 1 to June 30th (8/1, 11/1, 2/1, 5/1 in MA)

  Special Assessments = charges for improvements made to your property by the town 

  > e.g. sewer hookup, or street lighting ("betterments")

* Special Districts = tax districts that charge adjacent homeowners for services they receive

*Math: Property taxes*

>What is the annual property tax on a $100,000 home that is assessed at 40% of its value in a town with a millage rate of $20 per $1000?

$100,000 * 0.4 = $40,000 assessed value

$40,000 / $1,000 = 40 payments * $20 = $800 tax bill

> What is annual property tax on a $250,000 home assessed at 50% with a mileage rate of $15 per $1,000

$250,000 * 0.5 = $125,000 assessed value

$125,000 / $1,000 = 125 payments * $15 = $1,875

#### 4. Escheat (充公)

* reversionary interest in all privately owned property held by the state

## Private Limitations

Private limitations or restrictions (also known as CC&Rs) are contractual limitations on ownership created by deed or separate agreement. There are two basic kinds:

1. Covenants = contractual limitations in a subdivision
   * Must be uniformly applied to all the owners
2. Deed restrictions = contractual limitations written into your deed (receipt)
   *  Violation of a restriction can result in a lose of title

## Conflicts Between Public and Private Limitations

If there is ever a conflict between private restrictions and public zoning, the more restrictive rule wins. So, if a private restriction limits homeowners to 2.5 story buildings, but public zoning allows up to 3 stories, the homeowner would
be limited to 2.5 stories. 

## Environmental Limitations (p.20)

##### Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA)

Superfund Act.

##### Leaking Underground Storage Tank Program (LUST)

##### National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)

Requires property owners in "high risk flood zones" (think: waterfront property) to purchase flood insurance if their community participates in the NFIP and if they have a federally backed mortgage.

##### Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act 

The act requires a buffer zone (an area where you cannot build anything) of 100 feet from any wetlands. The DEP or local conservation commission may permit certain minor changes after 50 feet, and may also permit certain changes within the buffer zone, subject to DEP regulations, though typically no changes may be made to the wetland itself.

##### Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA)

A federal law designed to protect coastal zones (like the Gulf of Mexico or
Long Island Sound) from the harmful effects of real estate development. It limits, or completely eliminates, development in those zones.

##### LEED Certification



### Environmental Vocabulary

* Accretion – An increase of property by the gradual, natural action of wind or water (e.g. the slow increase of a beach).
* Aeolian Soil – Soil deposited by wind, such as sand dunes or silt.
* Alluvion – An increase of land area along a shore by deposited alluvium or by the recession of water (e.g. the slow increase of a riverbank).
* Alluvium – Any clay, silt, sand, gravel, or similar detrital material (sand, rocks, gravel, etc.) deposited by running water.
* Avulsion – The sudden separation of land from one property or its attachment to another, usually caused by flooding, a storm, or a change in the course of a river.
* Erosion – The process by which the surface of the earth is gradually worn away by natural actions (e.g. water, wind,etc.).
* Reliction – An increase of the land by the **sudden retreat** of the sea, lake, river, or other body of **water** (e.g. a sudden decrease in the water table).

## Other Property Right Concerns (p.22)

#### Easements

* Rights of way across another's property
* "Run with the land"
* Easements appurtenant = 2 adjacent lots of land
