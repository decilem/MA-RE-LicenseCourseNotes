### Personal vs Real Property

1. Attachment: is the property is permanently attached to land? (by nail or rods or directly/indirectly) 
2. adaptability: was it custom build to fit?
3. Intention: what was the intent of the person who installed the property (real or personal) usually more important for trade fixtures
4. Agreement: buyer & seller agree to treat a piece of property as real or personal regardless of that actually is = this overrides other tests

# Class 3 Interests in Real Estate

## Real Estate

* freehold Interest = Ownership
* Non-Freehold Interest = possessory w/o ownership
  * basically, rental

## Freeholds

1. Fee Simple Absolute
   * default form of ownership
   * own property absolutely
2. Life Estates
   * fee simple ownership for your life
   * pass away, lose property
   * Habendum Clause (物权转让条款)
3. Fee Simple Defeasible
   *  something can cause you to lose ownership
      * e.g. deed resctriction
   *  Determinable = auto
   *  Subject to a condition subsequent = lawsuit

## Severalty

1 person

A freehold interest (ownership) held by only one person. Its root is "severed"; ownership in severalty is the ownership of real estate severed from any co-owners.

## Co-ownership (should review) 

#### 1. Tenancy in Common

* default
* Inheritable 

#### 2. Joint Tenancy

Must：

	* *unity of time* Acquire ownership at same time
	* *unity of title* In the same deed
	* *unity of possession* All have equal right of possession
	* *unity of interest* All have equal interests 
	* Specify joint  ownership

Survivorship

* Last person standing
* Not inheritable

#### 3. Tenancy by the Entirety

* Joint tenancy for married couples
* Creditor protections
  * auto homestead

* The people living in the building own stock or shares in the company (or stock certificates)
* The cooperative will have a co-op board like a condominium board of trustees, and owners will pay monthly co-op fees
  for building expenses, similar to condo fees. Banks will typically accept stock in a cooperative as collateral for a loan.

#### 5. Timeshares

* Basically condos for time, rather than space, in the property
* Owner pays maintenance fees
* Also known as interval ownership, a prepaid vacation, or a floating use period.

## Securities 

* shares in companies, debt(bonds), etc.
* RE license doesn't let you broker these

   * investors receive returns base on performance of those properties

2. REIT

   Publicly traded portfolio of properties

3. REMIC

   * Trust that holds mortgage

## Non-Freeholds

Basically, rentals

- Leasehold = written conveyance of possession with a fixed timeframe (e.g. a 12 month lease)
- Tenancy at Will = verbal permission that either party may terminate

> In Massachusetts, lessor or lessee must give 30 day notice to vacate in order to terminate a tenancy at will.

- Periodic Tenancy = automatically renews on some pre-agreed interval until terminated (e.g. month to moth)
- Tenancy at Sufferance = holdover tenancy without landlord permission 
  - landlord must evict

> Remember, the terms estate, tenancy, and interest can be used interchangeably

* Always **negotiable**
* Include: What property the broker is selling, what commission they will be paid, the broker's authority and deadline for the sale

  * (most times, buyer's agents are paid by the seller as a co-broke
* Note: on the exam real estate commissions are treated as a cost for the seller
  * But buyers can pay commissions directly to their agent
  * (you could have a min commission in this agreement. If the seller compensation is less than the min, the buyer would make up the difference )

## Offers

* What is the purpose of an offer?
  * To reach an acceptable agreement between buyer and seller, so that the agreement is signed with the intention to move forward
* Offeror: give the offer (buyer, typically)
* Offeree: Seller, typically

> In a counter offer, those roles change

* An offer leads to the signing of a Purchase and Sale Contract (P&S)

# Class 4 Property Right Limitations 1

Page. 18

## Government Limitations

### P.E.T.E

#### 1. Police power

* the right of government to regulate private activity if it's in public interest to do so.
* Zoning = governs land use
  * e.g. use(residential, commercial, etc), height, setbacks, visual appearance, lot sizes, parking, open space, density, FARs, etc
  * 3 ways around zoning: 
    1. **on-conforming use**: A legal use that existed prior to the enactment of current zoning ordinances
    2. **variance**: Special permission to do something otherwise forbidden by the zoning rules
    3. **conditional use permits**: Think of this as a limited variance. Conditional use permits (CUPs)
       allow a commercial or residential use
* Building codes = govern how you build
  * Building codes define basic requirements for construction without necessarily prescribing implementation
  * Certificate of Occupancy (C/O) = proves that the property was built up to code and is safe for occupancy

#### 2. Eminent Domain (土地征用权)

* Right of government to force the sale of privately owned property 

#### 3. Taxes

**municipal property taxes**

* Taxes assessed against your property by the town or city (municipality)

* Pay for most of the things the town or city does

* Taxes run with land

  * Towns can foreclose for unpaid taxes
  * Superpriority lien
  * Equitable right of redemption= 1 year from the date of sale

* Taxes are charged on the assessed value of your property

* Taxes are charged in mills ($1 per $1,000)

* Paid quarterly or semi-annually on a fiscal year running from July 1 to June 30th (8/1, 11/1, 2/1, 5/1 in MA)

  Special Assessments = charges for improvements made to your property by the town 

  > e.g. sewer hookup, or street lighting ("betterments")

* Special Districts = tax districts that charge adjacent homeowners for services they receive

*Math: Property taxes*

>What is the annual property tax on a $100,000 home that is assessed at 40% of its value in a town with a millage rate of $20 per $1000?

$100,000 * 0.4 = $40,000 assessed value

$40,000 / $1,000 = 40 payments * $20 = $800 tax bill

> What is annual property tax on a $250,000 home assessed at 50% with a mileage rate of $15 per $1,000

$250,000 * 0.5 = $125,000 assessed value

$125,000 / $1,000 = 125 payments * $15 = $1,875

#### 4. Escheat (充公)

* reversionary interest in all privately owned property held by the state

## Private Limitations

Private limitations or restrictions (also known as CC&Rs) are contractual limitations on ownership created by deed or separate agreement. There are two basic kinds:

1. Covenants = contractual limitations in a subdivision
   * Must be uniformly applied to all the owners
2. Deed restrictions = contractual limitations written into your deed (receipt)
   *  Violation of a restriction can result in a lose of title

## Conflicts Between Public and Private Limitations

If there is ever a conflict between private restrictions and public zoning, the more restrictive rule wins. So, if a private restriction limits homeowners to 2.5 story buildings, but public zoning allows up to 3 stories, the homeowner would
be limited to 2.5 stories. 

## Environmental Limitations (p.20)

##### Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA)

Superfund Act.

##### Leaking Underground Storage Tank Program (LUST)

Underground Storage Tank program

##### MA Oil and Hazardous Material Release Prevention and Response Act (Chapter 21E)

Regulates pollution of navigable (and connected) waters. 

[Cuyahoga River Fire](http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Cuyahoga_River_Fire)

##### National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)

Requires property owners in "high risk flood zones" (think: waterfront property) to purchase flood insurance if their community participates in the NFIP and if they have a federally backed mortgage.

[Flood Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/09/29/554603161/episode-797-flood-money)

##### Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act 

The act requires a buffer zone (an area where you cannot build anything) of 100 feet from any wetlands. The DEP or local conservation commission may permit certain minor changes after 50 feet, and may also permit certain changes within the buffer zone, subject to DEP regulations, though typically no changes may be made to the wetland itself.

[MA Wetland and Wetland Change Areas Map](http://maps.massgis.state.ma.us/images/dep/omv/wetviewer.htm)

##### Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA)

A federal law designed to protect coastal zones (like the Gulf of Mexico or
Long Island Sound) from the harmful effects of real estate development. It limits, or completely eliminates, development in those zones.

##### LEED Certification

* Aeolian Soil – Soil deposited by wind, such as sand dunes or silt.
* Alluvion – An increase of land area along a shore by deposited alluvium or by the recession of water (e.g. the slow increase of a riverbank).
* Alluvium – Any clay, silt, sand, gravel, or similar detrital material (sand, rocks, gravel, etc.) deposited by running water.
* Avulsion – The sudden separation of land from one property or its attachment to another, usually caused by flooding, a storm, or a change in the course of a river.
* Erosion – The process by which the surface of the earth is gradually worn away by natural actions (e.g. water, wind,etc.).
