* Prof Liability Insurance
  * errors and omissions or E&O
  * Errors and ommissions insurance is liability insurance that will cover mistakes made by a broker or their agents. 
  * E&O will not cover fair housing or consumer protection lawsuits. General liability insurance would cover personal property being broken



# Class 02 Property Rights

> Study Guide p.11  

## Outline

* Types of property
* Real property
* Air rights
* Mineral rights
* Riparian rights
* Littoral rights
* Personal Property
* Difference between real and personal property
* Exceptions to the rules
* Changing property types



### Types of Property

* Property = anything subject to ownership
* Two major types of Property
  * Real Property = land and everything with it
    * Real estate, realty, immovable property, fixtures
  * Personal property = anything ~not associated~ with LAND
    * personality, chattel, **moveable** property

### Real Property 

Transferred with a Deed
	* Deed = Receipt for real estate
		* conves legal title (ownership)
	* Grantor vs. Grantee

> or: giver.    ee: receiver  

### Bundle of Rights

Right to Possession (own it)
Right to Control (use it)
Right to  Enjoyment(use it in legal way)
Right to Exclusion (limit access to)
Right to Disposition (rent, sell, will)

### Extended Land Rights

1. Land rights (surface rights) 30ft below

* Appurtenances 
  * chimney, mail box
* Improvement (permanently attached to land) direct or indirect
  * Fixtures

2.  Air rights  (US v Causby)
    * tallest improvement 80ft ~ 500 ft.   (FAA navigable air space)
    * can be leased out
3. mineral rights (sub surface rights) 
   1. Solid mineral (Gold/silver/iron)

   2. liquid mineral (oil, gas) free flowing

   3. Implied easement 

      > An implied easement allows an owner who purchase mineral rights separately from the land itself to harvest those minerals automatically.

Rules of Capture
	1. Doctrine of Capture: you capture first, you get it first
	2. Utilization Pooling: share it, pool it

4. Riparians Rights (river)

   1. Ripariansm
      Use in the original 13 colonies 

   * non-navigable (mid points to mid) no boats
   * navigable (accretion line) boats

   2.  Doctrine of Prior Appropriation

   * Use for water rights in Western States
   * First come. First serve

5. Littoral rights

   * Littoral = **L**arge bodies of water (lakes, oceans and ponds)
   * accretion line (high tide)
   * *mass* (special)
     * extend from mean high water line to mean low water line or 100 rods / 1650 feet(whichever is less

6. Personal Property

   * any property not associated with land
   * Bill of Sale = Receipt for personal property

### Personal vs Real Property

1. Attachment: is the property is permanently attached to land? (by nail or rods or directly/indirectly) 
2. adaptability: was it custom build to fit?
3. Intention: what was the intent of the person who installed the property (real or personal) usually more important for trade fixtures
4. Agreement: buyer & seller agree to treat a piece of property as real or personal regardless of that actually is = this overrides other tests
   * Statute of Frauds: Real estate contracts in writing agreements should be in writing.

### Exceptions to the rules

* Trade fixtures = business property = personal property

  * e.g. jewelry display cases 

  > installed for specific business use (commercial)

* emblements = annual or semi-annual crops = personal property

  * e.g. corn or wheat

  > planted with the expectation of being harvested/pulled from  the land

### Changing Property Types

1. Annexation(add) = personal property becomes real property
   * planting a tree
2. Severance () = real -> personal
   * digging up a tree

### checkpoint

1. solar panels: R
2. Shed: R
3. Backyard swing set: R if attached
4. washing machine: P 
5. Refrigerator: P
6. Avocado tree: R
7. Corn crop: P
8. Hair salon chair: P (business)



# Class 03 

# Interests in Real Estate

## Real Estate

* freehold Interest = Ownership
* Non-Freehold Interest = possessory w/o ownership
  * basically, rental

## Freeholds

1. Fee Simple Absolute
   * default form of ownership
   * own property absolutely
2. Life Estates
   * fee simple ownership for your life
   * pass away, lose property 
     * **Reversion**
     * **Pur Autre Vie**
   * Habendum *Clause* 
     * remiander
3. Fee Simple Defeasible
   *  something can cause you to lose ownership
      * e.g. deed resctriction
   *  Determinable = auto
   *  Subject to a condition subsequent = lawsuit

![image-20210421151241526](image/image-20210421151241526.png)

## Severalty

**1 person**

A freehold interest (ownership) held by only one person. Its root is "severed"; ownership in severalty is the ownership of real estate severed from any co-owners.

## Co-ownership (should review) 

#### 1. Tenancy in Common

* default
* Inheritable 

#### 2. Joint Tenancy

**Must：**

* *unity of time* Acquire ownership at same time
* *unity of title* In the same deed
* *unity of possession* All have equal right of possession
* *unity of interest* All have equal interests 
* Specify joint  ownership

**Survivorship**

* Last person standing
* Not inheritable

#### 3. Tenancy by the Entirety

* Joint tenancy for married couples
* Creditor protections
  * auto homestead
  * forced sale for debts of one spouse only
* On divorce, automatically become a tenancy in common



#### 4. Condominium

Joint ownership of common areas, and fee simple ownership of units

* Master Deed (condo building)
* Unit deed
* Condo Association
  * Declaration of **Trust**
  * Bylaws(内部章程) of the Association
* Condo Fees
  * Super-priority lien
  * run with land
  * 6D certificate (what‘s going on the fee)
  * special assessment

#### 4. Cooperatives

* Cooperative(LLC) owns the building

* The people living in the building own stock or shares in the company (or stock certificates)
* The cooperative will have a co-op board like a condominium board of trustees, and owners will pay monthly co-op fees
  for building expenses, similar to condo fees. Banks will typically accept stock in a cooperative as collateral for a loan.

#### 5. Timeshares

* Basically condos for time, rather than space, in the property
* Owner pays maintenance fees
* Also known as interval ownership, a prepaid vacation, or a floating use period.

## Securities 

* shares in companies, debt(bonds), etc.
* RE license doesn't let you broker these

1. Syndications

   * Corporation that invests in 1 or more pieces of RE
   * investors receive returns base on performance of those properties

2. REIT

   Publicly traded portfolio of properties

3. REMIC

   * Trust that holds mortgage
   * Pays investors on the performance of the mortgages

## Non-Freeholds

Basically, rentals

- Leasehold = written conveyance of possession with a fixed timeframe (e.g. a 12 month lease)
- Tenancy at Will = verbal permission that either party may terminate

> In Massachusetts, lessor or lessee must give 30 day notice to vacate in order to terminate a tenancy at will.

- Periodic Tenancy = automatically renews on some pre-agreed interval until terminated (e.g. month to moth)
- Tenancy at Sufferance = holdover tenancy without landlord permission 
  - landlord must evict

> Remember, the terms estate, tenancy, and interest can be used interchangeably



# Class 0405 

# Property Right Limitations 1

Page. 18

## Government Limitations

### P.E.T.E

#### 1. Police power

* the right of government to regulate private activity if it's in public interest to do so.
* Zoning = governs land use
  * e.g. use(residential, commercial, etc), height, setbacks, visual appearance, lot sizes, parking, open space, density, FARs, etc
  * 3 ways around zoning: 
    1. **on-conforming use**: A legal use that existed prior to the enactment of current zoning ordinances
    2. **variance**: Special permission to do something otherwise forbidden by the zoning rules
    3. **conditional use permits**: Think of this as a limited variance. Conditional use permits (CUPs)
       allow a commercial or residential use
* Building codes = govern how you build
  * Building codes define basic requirements for construction without necessarily prescribing implementation
  * Certificate of Occupancy (C/O) = proves that the property was built up to code and is safe for occupancy

#### 2. Eminent Domain (土地征用权)

* Right of government to force the sale of privately owned property 

#### 3. Taxes

**municipal property taxes**

* Taxes assessed against your property by the town or city (municipality)

* Pay for most of the things the town or city does

* Taxes run with land

  * Towns can foreclose for unpaid taxes
  * Superpriority lien
  * Equitable right of redemption= 1 year from the date of sale

* Taxes are charged on the assessed value of your property

* Taxes are charged in mills ($1 per $1,000)

* Paid quarterly or semi-annually on a fiscal year running from July 1 to June 30th (8/1, 11/1, 2/1, 5/1 in MA)

  Special Assessments = charges for improvements made to your property by the town 

  > e.g. sewer hookup, or street lighting ("betterments")

* Special Districts = tax districts that charge adjacent homeowners for services they receive

*Math: Property taxes*

>What is the annual property tax on a $100,000 home that is assessed at 40% of its value in a town with a millage rate of $20 per 1000?

$100,000 * 0.4 = $40,000 assessed value

$40,000 / $1,000 = 40 payments * $20 = $800 tax bill

> What is annual property tax on a $250,000 home assessed at 50% with a mileage rate of $15 per $1,000

$250,000 * 0.5 = $125,000 assessed value

$125,000 / $1,000 = 125 payments * $15 = $1,875

#### 4. Escheat (充公)

* reversionary interest in all privately owned property held by the state

## Private Limitations

Private limitations or restrictions (also known as CC&Rs) are contractual limitations on ownership created by deed or separate agreement. There are two basic kinds:

1. Covenants = contractual limitations in a subdivision
   * Must be uniformly applied to all the owners
2. Deed restrictions = contractual limitations written into your deed (receipt)
   *  Violation of a restriction can result in a lose of title

## Conflicts Between Public and Private Limitations

If there is ever a conflict between private restrictions and public zoning, the more restrictive rule wins. So, if a private restriction limits homeowners to 2.5 story buildings, but public zoning allows up to 3 stories, the homeowner would
be limited to 2.5 stories. 

## Environmental Limitations (p.20)

##### Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA)

Superfund Act.

##### Leaking Underground Storage Tank Program (LUST)

Underground Storage Tank program

##### MA Oil and Hazardous Material Release Prevention and Response Act (Chapter 21E)

##### The Clean Water Act of 1972 (CWA) 

Regulates pollution of navigable (and connected) waters. 

[Cuyahoga River Fire](http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Cuyahoga_River_Fire)

##### National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)

Requires property owners in "high risk flood zones" (think: waterfront property) to purchase flood insurance if their community participates in the NFIP and if they have a federally backed mortgage.

[Flood Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/09/29/554603161/episode-797-flood-money)

##### Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act 

The act requires a buffer zone (an area where you cannot build anything) of 100 feet from any wetlands. The DEP or local conservation commission may permit certain minor changes after **50 feet**, and may also permit certain changes within the buffer zone, subject to DEP regulations, though typically no changes may be made to the wetland itself.

[MA Wetland and Wetland Change Areas Map](http://maps.massgis.state.ma.us/images/dep/omv/wetviewer.htm)

##### Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA)

A federal law designed to protect coastal zones (like the Gulf of Mexico or
Long Island Sound) from the harmful effects of real estate development. It limits, or completely eliminates, development in those zones.

##### LEED Certification



### Environmental Vocabulary

* Accretion – An increase of property by the gradual, natural action of **wind or water** (e.g. the slow increase of a beach).
* Aeolian Soil – Soil deposited by **wind**, such as sand dunes or silt.
* Alluvion – An increase of land area along a shore by **deposited alluvium** or by the **recession of water** (e.g. the slow increase of a riverbank).
* Alluvium – Any clay, silt, sand, gravel, or similar detrital material (sand, rocks, gravel, etc.) deposited by running water.
* Avulsion – The sudden separation of land from one property or its attachment to another, usually caused by flooding, a storm, or a change in the course of a river.
* Erosion – The process by which the surface of the earth is gradually worn away by natural actions (e.g. water, wind,etc.).
* Reliction – An increase of the land by the **sudden retreat** of the sea, lake, river, or other body of **water** (e.g. a sudden decrease in the water table).

## Other Property Right Concerns (p.22)

#### Easements

* Rights of way across another's property
* "Run with the land"
* Easements appurtenant = 2 adjacent lots of land
  * 4 ways to create:
    1. Deed
    2. Implication
    3. Necessity
    4. Prescription
* Easements in gross = personal held easements

#### Licenses

Personal, revocable and non-assignable permission to enter someone else's property for a particular purpose (e.g. ticket holders in sporting events).

#### Encroachments

The intrusion of an improvement onto a neighboring property (e.g. a misaligned fence). Failure to take action against an encroachment may result in a loss of the land (again via O.N.C.H.A. with a 20-year time frame).



## Financial Limitations (Liens)

* General Lien = covers ALL property (Personal + Real)
* Specific Lien = covers just one piece of property (usually real estate)

#### Voluntary Liens

* Mortgage = lien for the purposes of securing a real estate loan
  * Mortgagor = borrower, mortgagee = bank
* Installment Sales Contracts = agree to make payments for property. and don't legal title until you make your final payment
  * Equitable title = a future right to acquire legal title

#### Involuntary Liens

* Property Tax Liens = lien for unpaid property taxes
* Federal Tax liens = general liens for delinquent federal taxs
  * Estate Tax liens = liens against an estate for unpaid taxes
* Mechanic's Lien = a protection for contractors against non-payment
* Judgments = final decision by a court, can result a sheriff's sale
* Attachments = legal seizure of property to satisfy a possible judgment 
  * Lis Pendens = recorded notice of the attachment





# Class 06 

# Transfer of Property Part 1

Study guide p.49

## Transfer of Property

* How is real estate transferred?
  * Conveyed with a Deed
* What are deeds?
  * Legal document that transfers title, or ownership - like a receipt
* What is the difference between a deed and title
  * the deed is physical document, where "title" is a **concept**. Concept of ownership
* Who are the parties involved in a title transfer
  * Grantor ("or" give):  typically, a seller (or owner)
  * Grantee("ee" accept): typically, a buyer 

## Title

- Title = ownership  (the concept of ownership)

  > **Alienation** – loss of ownership; 
  >
  > * can be voluntary, such as in a real estate sale 
  > * or involuntary, such as in a foreclosure

- A property owner can lose title
  - Involuntary Alienation
    - Forced loss of ownership (Foreclosure or Tax sale)
  - Voluntary Alienation
    - Willing loss of ownership

## Deed

#### Purpose of a Deed: 

document that transfers title - ownership

#### Deeds Essentials:

* Must be in writing
* Grantor must be legally competent
* Signature of the **grantor**
* Must name Grantee
* Involve the exchange of of *consideration* 
* Include a full legal description of land
* Include a granting clause
* Delivery and acceptance 

> Grantee signature is not required.
>
> Date is not required

## Recordation

* What is recordation?
  * Act of making title transfer public record at county registry of deeds
  * Provides constructive notice = public notice
    * As compared to actual notice = told something specifically 
* Recordation is recommended, but **NOT required** 

## Land Description & Surveys

* Full legal land description (one of the essentials of a valid )



#### Land Survey Measurements

You might see a number of units of measurement used in the survey. They are:

1 link: 7.92 inches (call it 8 inches for memorization)
1 foot: 12 inches
1 yard: 3 feet
1 rod: **16 feet 6 inches**
1 chain: 66 feet
1 furlong: 660 feet
1 mile: **5,280 feet**
1 acre: 43,560 square feet (1 chain x 1 furlong)
1 square mile: 640 acres  (5280^2=27,878,400/43,560=640)

#### Metes and Bounds

* Metes and Bounds Survey (used in the original 13 colonies)
  * Most common land description
  * Point of beginning and the ending are always the same
  * Lot lines or boundaries of the property are always description

An example metes and bounds survey might read:

> "A plot of land located in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, beginning at the intersection of Canal and Causeway
> Street, running south along Canal Street 304 feet, West to Friend Street 150 feet more or less, North to the intersection of
> Causeway Street and Friend Street, then East along Causeway Street to the intersection of Canal and Causeway Street."

#### Lot and Block

Plat maps are another method of surveying land. They are the recorded plans for a subdivision or municipality, and use the lot and block method. The lot and block method divides the property by streets into blocks, and then subdivides those blocks into lots using the metes and bounds method for each individual lot. The total area of the parcel of land is also described using a metes and bounds survey. 

An example Lot and Block survey might read:

> "Lot 43, Block 17, Green Acre Homes in the City of Portland, according to the plat thereof, recording in Volume 6 of plats, page 84, in Multnomah County, Oregon."

#### Government Rectangular Survey System

![image-20210125181919174](image/image-20210125181919174.png)

- Squares created by the intersecting of tiers and range lines = townships
- Townships are 6 miles x 6 miles
  - Contains 36 square miles (23,040 acres) 

* Townships = divided into 36 **sections**

  * Sections = 1 mile x 1 mile  (**640 acres**)
  * Numbered 1-36
  * Northeastern Corner always #1
  * 16th section = school section

  ![townerships](image/image-20210125182425733.png)

* Section are divided into

  1. Halves of 320 acres
  2. Quarters of 160 acres
  3. Further subdivided into quarters and halves

![image-20210125183040309](image/image-20210125183040309.png)

* Sizes for each area in a Government Rectangular Survey 
  * Quadrangle/Check: 24 miles by 24 miles, 576 square miles, or 368,640 acres
  * Township: 6 miles by 6 miles, 36 square miles, or 23,040 acres
  * Section: 1 mile by 1 mile, 1 square mile, or 640 acres
  * Half-Section: 1 mile by ½ mile, ½ square mile, or 320 acres
  * Quarter Section: ½ mile by ½ mile, ¼ square mile, or 160 acres
  * ½ of a Quarter Section: ½ mile by ¼ mile, 1/8 square mile, or 80 acres
  * ¼ of a Quarter Section: ¼ by ¼ miles, 1/16 square mile, or 40 acres





## Types of Deeds

#### General Warranty Deed

= warranty Deeds

* Grantor accepts all liability and offers extended warranties

#### Special Warranty Deed(limited warranty deed)

* Grantor is only liable for any title claims that originated during the ownership
* Grantor promises they did not cause any title issues

#### Bargain and Sale Deed (court)

* Grantor states they have a right to convey ownership, even if they do not own the ownership

#### Quitclaim Deeds = Non warranty Deed

* Grantor offers no warranties and is not liable for any claims against title
* Grantor conveys only the interest he/she has at the time of transfer
* Most commonly seen in bank foreclosures or to correct a mistake in public record

> In MA - This is the same as a special warranty deed, with title insurance

#### Deeds of Trust or Trust Deed (not tested)

#### Reconveyance Deeds

* Trustees will often use this type of deed
* Used to return property to trustors

#### Trustee's Deeds

* Executed by a trustee to transfer real estate to anyone who isn't the trustor

#### Deeds executed pursuant to a court order

* Issued as a result of the order in a will or a court



# Class 07 

# Transfer of Property Part 2

study guide p.50

## Timeline of Property Transfer

1. Property is listed, then put under agreement via the signing of the P&S
2. Lender hires an attorney or title company to conduct a title search
   * Title search = examination of the chain of title
   * If there are any clouds on title, seller mist fix before closing

3. Seller provides a deed to the buyer transferring ownership of the property
4. Buyers gives the lender a note as evidence of their debt and a mortgage to secure the debt
5. Last minute title search to verify nothing has changed
6. When closing is complete all documents are recorded at the registry of deeds along with the municipal lien certificate

* After recording, seller's attorney pays the listing brokerage
* Listing brokerage pays the buyer's agent's brokerage
* Any recorded documents are duplicated and digitized to provide a public record of transfer
  * Available in MA at www.masslandrecords.com
  * 

## MA Recording Stamps

Massachusetts Recording Stamps

* Also known as documentary, excise, revenue, transfer or conveyance stamps
* Transfer fee
* Expense paid by the grantor
* Do not implant

#### Math

A property sold for $505,100, how much stamps?

1. Round up $505,100 -> 505,500

2. How many stamps need to pay?
   * $505,500/500=1011$

3. How much ? 
   * $1011*2.28=2305.08$
   * 



## Title Insurance

* Title insurance = insurance policy that protects against undiscoverable title defects
* Doesn't cover ownership issues that could be discovered via public record or any private or public property right restrictions
* Lender require a lender's policy (paid by borrower) = Mortgagee protection
* Borrower/Homeowner can get their own policy = Mortgagor Protection
  * Standard Coverage 
  * Extended Coverage

## Land Court

* The Torrens System (provides certainty of title to land)
  * Deals with conflicts about property ownership
  * Action to Quite Title
  * Performs title search and then holds hearings to determine who is the rightful owner of the property 
  * Once decision is made, it issues a Certificate of Title
    * Certificate of Title registers land = **this overrides all prior documents**

* Registered Land
  * Transfer must be recorded
  * Transfer not valid

## Other Title Transfer Methods

#### Wills

* How property of the deceased in transferred
  * Intestate: die without a will
  * Testate: die with a will

#### 

* If the deceased passed testate (with will)
  * Executor is named and carries out last wished
  * The executor devises (transfers) real property to the devisees (heirs receiving real property), and bequeaths (transfers) the personal property (the bequest or legacy) to the legatees (heirs receiving personal property).
* If the deceased passes intestate, (without will)
  * Admin is appointed by court
  * Laws of descent and distribution will govern who receives the property
* If deceased passed intestate and without heirs, (no will, no heirs)
  * Escheat
* Codicils = amendments to wills 
* Holographic = handwritten wills
* Nuncupative will = verbal wills
  * Not enforceable in most states
* Property owned with others in a will is known as =
  * Et ux: with wife
  * Et con: with husband
  * Et al: with others

#### Adverse Possession

* Legal term for squatters rights
* O.N.C.H.A (open, notorious, continuous, hostile and adverts use)
* 20 years+
* Doesn't apply to public or registered land

#### Dedication 

> Private person donates land usually for a public use

* Donation of property rights
* Can be permanent or temporary



# Class 08 

# Contracts

## Essentials of contracts and Statues

![image-20210124235807054](image\image-20210124235807054.png)

**Valid**: has all 4 essentials legally binding

**Voidable**: missing reality of consent & competence 

* Move forward or
* Go to a judge and ask to void it

**Void**: missing #1 #2 #3 not legally binding

#### 1. Offer & Acceptance (meeting of the minds)

- Shown by signatures or action electronic signatures are binding

- Real Estate contracts must be in writing per Statute of Frauds 

#### 2. Consideration

* Valuable Consideration 

#### 3. Legal Object

* Contract to do something illegal is NOT a contract

#### 4. Reality of Consent and Competence

1. Freedom from:
   * Misrepresentation

p.25

## What is a value?

What is value

Value is how much a ready, willing, and able buyer will pay for something, and a willing and informed seller will accept.

* Who determines value

  Buyer

* What is the difference between an appraisal and a CMA/BPO

  * Appraiser will estimate the value of the property and write an appraisal
  * Real estate agents can estimate the value of property through a comparative market analysis or broker price opinion

#### Real Estate Agents & Value

CMA – Comparative (or competitive) Market Analysis; used to determine listing price; typically based on price per square foot; a broker or their subagent’s opinion of real estate’s value based on evaluating data of comparative properties; also known as BPO





#### Elements of Value (D.U.S.T.)

* **D**emand – The number of people that want to buy the property (and are actually able to do so).
* **U**tility – Something’s **usefulness**. The more useful it is, the more demand there is.
* **S**upply (or Scarcity) – How many are there? The more plentiful something is, the less it is worth (and vice versa).
* **T**ransferability – Sellable real estate must be free from clouds on title (issues with ownership). This is known as having good and clear title or marketable title. Real estate with title defects is difficult to sell, and thus has lower value.
  * e.g. Lien

#### Types of Real Estate Value

- Market Value – The theoretical price a ready, willing, and able buyer would pay, and a willing, informed seller would accept in an arms-length transaction (a sale with no collusion between the buyer and seller). Also known as fair market value.
- Market Price – The actual amount paid in the market.
- Value-in-Use – The value to a particular user of a property (e.g. farm value vs. raw real estate value).
- Cost – The total **cost to build** a property.
- Investment Value – The value of a property for investors.
  - CLUE： Comprehensive loss underwriting exchange
- Insurable Value – The value of a property for insurance. The Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange (CLUE) records past consumer claims that are used in homeowner's insurance underwriting.
- Assessed Value – The tax value of a property.
- Liquidation Value – The foreclosure value of a property.

### The Principle of Value

* Change:  Real estate values change
* Anticipation: Expected benefit of real estate ownership
  * function of change
* Substitution: Buyer will not pay more for something than what is costs for a comparable good (neighboring values influence a buyer's opinion of value)
* Progression/Regression:  Increase/decrease of property value due to substitution
  * Appreciation: Increase of value
  * Depreciation: Decrease of value
* Four Stage life cycle

![image-20210127121554006](image/image-20210127121554006.png)

* Balance: Value is created/maintained when there is a balance of different types of real estate (i.e. balance between commercial property and residential property)
* Conformity: Maximum value is achieved when properties are similar
* Contribution: Additional Investment in real estate (typically provides increase in value)
* Increasing/Decreasing Returns: Spending money to improve a property may not equate to an increase in value
  * Over improvement: Too much spent
  * Under improvement:  Too little spent
* Competition: Profit attracts competition
  * Competition leads to supply, which leads to a decrease in value
* Consistent Use: Value of land can't be based on a higher speculative use
* Highest and Best Use: Most optimal use

### Influences on Property Value

Basic forces that influence the value of real estate

* Social Trends
  * Open floor plan
  * Mudroom
* Economic
  * If the economy is doing well then values are up
* Government and legal
  * Taxes, zoning and building

* Environmental and Physical
  * Location, location, location! Think: proximity to transportation and  highways, natural resources, climate, views, etc.
  * location to amenities, major roads, etc

### Depreciation

* Depreciation = loss in value due to aging of a property

  * Accrued Depreciation = already occurred when property purchased

  ...

#### Types of Depreciation

Loss of value can occur due to any of the following:

* Physical Deterioration
  * **Aging**, wear and tear, or neglect of the building
  * Curable
* Functional Obsolescence
  * Poor/Outdated designed or change in building standards
  * Curable
* Economic Obsolescence
  * External factors have a negative impact
  * Incurable

## Capitalization Rate

* Another way to value investment property
* Capitalization Rate(Cap Rate) = the percentage of the property value that an investor expects to receive as NOI every year
  * More reliable than GRM
  
  * Investors usually have a goal cap rate
  
  * Formula: $Cap Rate=NOI/Sales price$
  
    > **Net income** – also known as net operating income (NOI), it is the effective gross income minus operating expenses

#### Capitalization Rate Math

Formula: NOI/Sales Price = Cap Rate



## Cash on Cash Return

* Most popular investment value options for investors
* Most on Cash Return = return on investor's cash investment
  * Helps investors determine how their real estate is performing
  * Percentage of total investment received as annual cash flow (before taxes)
  * Formula: Cash Flow before taxes/ Dollars Invested= Cash on Cash return
* Ideally, investors want cash on cash return to be higher  than cap rate
* Cash flow after taxes will change anytime a debt service payment is made

#### Cash on Cash Return Math

Formula: Cash Flow/Dollars Invested = Cash on Cash return 



## Cost Approach

* Cost Approach = using the cost of construction to estimate value
  * Used for unique properties with no comps or income
  * e.g. a church or brand new construction

#### Math

Example of final real estate value using cost approach

$520,000 Estimated replacement/reproduction cost

-$60,000 Less depreciation costs

___

$460,000 Estimated improved value of property

+$92,000 Land value (calculated using sales comparison approach)

---

$552,000 Final estimated real estate value

# Class 13 Introduction to Financing

p.69

## Introduction to Financing

#### What is financing?

Receiving, or providing, money the the purchase of real estate 

#### Key terms

* Note: Evidence of the debt - promissory note
* Mortgage: secures the debts - you give this to the lender
* Collateral: The property

#### Parties involved in a financing arrangement

* Mortgagor: Borrower, or buyer
* Mortgagee: Lender 

## Financing Steps

1. Buyer applies to a lender for a loan

   * Usually done before they start looking
   * Have been pre-approval? Have you gone through the pre-approval process?

2. Lender uses gross salary, credit history, and debt to income ratio to assess a buyer's ability to pay for the loan

   * Income, stability and source of income, net worth, credit

   > DTI - % of debt, compared to your total income

3. Buyer receives a pre-approval or pre-qualification letter

   * Pre-qualification - Collect into from you, but don't validate everything
   * Pre-approval - Validate the info

4. Buyer finds a property to purchase

5. After P&S is signed, the lender hires an appraiser to determine if collateral（抵押品） for the loan is sufficient to cover the loan in the event of a default

6. Lender's attorney conducts a title  search to determine

7. dada

8. At closing, the lender creates the loan for the buyer and in return, the borrower gives a note as evidence of the debt, along with the mortgage, securing the debt

9. Over the term of the loan, the borrowers pays back the loan. Upon repayment, the mortgage discharges and the borrower/homeowner now owns the home free and clear.

*if the borrower defaults on the terms of the load, the lender can foreclose on the 

## Foreclosure

#### What is foreclosure?

A legal process, where the lender attempts to recover the balance of a loan from a borrower in default, by forcing a sale.

* Judicial Foreclosure: Court supervised, and initiated by a lawsuit
* Non-Judicial Foreclosure: follows a process - "power of sale" clause in a mortgage allows for this

Foreclosures are usually done by public auction

* Bank grants title to the highest bidder by signing and delivering new deed to the new owner (could be the bank itself)

After foreclosure, depending on the sale price, the borrower will either receive or own money to the bank

* If the proceeds from the sale are in excess of the borrower's debt plus lender's expense = borrower will receive their leftover equality
* If the proceeds from the sale are short and don't cover the debt plus lender's expenses = borrow is personal liable 

If the highest bidder was the bank itself = the bank owns the property and will sell it on the open market

* SEO

#### Preventing Foreclosure

Equity Right of Redemption

* Homeowner can buy back their home if before the auction they can repay the lander that is owed plus the costs of foreclosure

Short sale

* Homeowner sells their home "short" of what they own to the bank
* Bank settles for less money and writes off the loss
* Typically occurs when homeowner owes more that that the home is worth
* Bank agrees to take whatever price they can get on the open market
  * Must approve the sale price
  * Can take 6 months +

## The Notes and the Mortgage

Clauses in the Note

* Acceleration Clause: permits the lender to accelerate the maturity date of the loan if there is a default on the terms of the mortgage
  * Calling in the note: 1st step in foreclosure
* Prepayment Penalty Clause: requires the borrower to pay a penalty for prepaying the loan
  * Used to guarantee that the lender gets paid entire interest on the loan (common in commercial)

Mortgage: provides piece of property as collateral for the loan

* Lien, not the loan
* Borrower hypothecates their property - give up the security interest, but retains possession

So who holds title?

**Lien Theory State** (FL NY ME RI):

* borrower holds legal title of a property that is financed

**Title Theory State** (MA):

* a state where the bank holds legal title to mortgaged property, and the borrower holds equitable title

## Mortgage (p.67)

* Mortgage  Covenants: borrower's promises
* Power of Sale Clause: allows lender to take the property and sell it if the borrower defaults on the terms of the loan
* Defeasance Clause: automatically relives the collateral of the bank claim when the loan is paid bank
* Due on Sale Clause: entire payment

> **Due on sale clause** – also known as alienation or assumption clause; permits lender to accelerate maturity date of the loan in the event of a title transfer; prevents transfer of mortgage to a third party

* Garn-St. Germain Act: Due on sale clause can't triggered on death, devising property, leasing, marriage, divorce or transfer to a family trust
* Subordination Clause: 

## Points

Points: use to increase the value of the loan

* 1 point = 1% of the loan amount
* If the interest rate is so low that the lender won't make much money, they can charge points to borrower as an origination fee in order to increase profits
* Discount Point: can be paid up front by the borrower

> Points only paid on the **loan amount**	



## Mortgage Broker vs Bankers

Mortgage Broker

* 3rd parties
* Don't originate (make) loans
* Offer a variety of loan products from different investors/banks
* Broker charges a fee
* Can be great for tricky loan situations

Mortgage Bankers

* Work directly for the bank
* Originate loans
* Offer products only from their bank
* No broker fee

## Fully Amortized Loans

* Fully Amortized Loans Vocabulary
  * Amortization = payment of debt in equal payments
  * Debt service = PRincipal and Interest
  * Principal = amount borrowed (debt) or loan amount 

* Fully Amortized Loans = loans that are completely paid off when last payment is made
  * Also know as **Direct Reduction Loans**
  * Debt service pays both principal & interest
* PITI Payment
  * Principal
  * Interest
  * Taxes
  * Insurance (home owners insurance)

* How to fully amortized loans work?
  * Every mouth the same payment is made but the amount going towards principal and interest will change and at the last payment the loan is paid off in full
* Amount going toward principal & interest changes over the life of the loan
  * Recalculated monthly
  * Only **12 days** in a calendar year for calculation

* Principal payments are always residual
  * Difference between total payment & interest due
* With each payment made, amount of money going toward principal increases, while the amount going toward interest decreases
  * Final payoff = discharge

## Math using the amortization table

Formula = (loan/1000)* PI = monthly payment

* Fully Amortized Math

  ![image-20210223101032661](image/image-20210223101032661.png)

Second month payment 

$374,459.69*0.04 = 14978.39/12 = 1248.20$ (interest)

P&I=1790.31

Interest=1248.20

Amount to principal = 542.11

* Practice time

373,917.57*0.04=14956.70/12=1246.39

Amount to principal = 1790.31-1246.39=543.92

Answer: $373,917.57-543.92=373,373.65$ 

## Fixed vs Adjusted 

* A loan can be either fixed rate or adjustable rate
* Fixed Rate
  * Interest rate doesn't change over the life of the loan
* Adjustable Rate
  * Interest rate is usually lower in the beginning
    * Teaser or discounted rate
  * Interest rate adjusts based on prime rate(e.g. prime + 2pts)
  * Payment caps
    * If increase is higher than cap, bank will carry it over to next rate increase

## Types of Real Estate Financing

* Balloon Loans
  * Amortization period is longer than pay period
  * Balloon = unpaid principal at the end of the term

  * Loan plus interest must be repaid when home is sold or homeowner passes

  *Typically within 12 months of person dying*

## Types of Seller Financing for Real Estate

* Purchase Money Mortgage = Seller Financing

  * Seller = Mortgagee, Borrower = Mortgagor

  *Seller acts as bank or lender*

* FHA will insure the "riskiest" part of the loan in the  event of foreclosure

  * The bank is willing to lending to the buyer bc of the protection

* Buyers pays for the insurance as part of their monthly payment

  * Knowns as mortgage insurance (MI)

  * > MI - Comes from the government

* Monthly MI payments remain for the life of the loan

  * Can never be removed

  > Yes! Automatically removed when you reach 78% LTV
  >
  > 80% by request, Most commonly, through refinancing

  PMI can be shopped by the lender. If credit is better, PMI is lower.
