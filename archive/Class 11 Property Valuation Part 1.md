## What is a value?

What is value

Value is how much a ready, willing, and able buyer will pay for something, and a willing and informed seller will accept.

* Who determines value

  Buyer

* What is the difference between an appraisal and a CMA/BPO

  * Appraiser will estimate the value of the property and write an appraisal
  * Real estate agents can estimate the value of property through a comparative market analysis or broker price opinion

#### Real Estate Agents & Value

CMA – Comparative (or competitive) Market Analysis; used to determine listing price; typically based on price per square foot; a broker or their subagent’s opinion of real estate’s value based on evaluating data of comparative properties; also known as BPO





#### Elements of Value (D.U.S.T.)

* **D**emand – The number of people that want to buy the property (and are actually able to do so).
* **U**tility – Something’s **usefulness**. The more useful it is, the more demand there is.
* **S**upply (or Scarcity) – How many are there? The more plentiful something is, the less it is worth (and vice versa).
* **T**ransferability – Sellable real estate must be free from clouds on title (issues with ownership). This is known as having good and clear title or marketable title. Real estate with title defects is difficult to sell, and thus has lower value.
  * e.g. Lien

#### Types of Real Estate Value

- Market Value – The theoretical price a ready, willing, and able buyer would pay, and a willing, informed seller would accept in an arms-length transaction (a sale with no collusion between the buyer and seller). Also known as fair market value.
- Market Price – The actual amount paid in the market.
- Value-in-Use – The value to a particular user of a property (e.g. farm value vs. raw real estate value).
- Cost – The total **cost to build** a property.
- Investment Value – The value of a property for investors.
  - CLUE： Comprehensive loss underwriting exchange
- Insurable Value – The value of a property for insurance. The Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange (CLUE) records past consumer claims that are used in homeowner's insurance underwriting.
- Assessed Value – The tax value of a property.
- Liquidation Value – The foreclosure(抵押品赎回) value of a property.

### The Principle of Value

* Change:  Real estate values change
* Anticipation: Expected benefit of real estate ownership
  * function of change
* Substitution: Buyer will not pay more for something than what is costs for a comparable good (neighboring values influence a buyer's opinion of value)
* Progression/Regression:  Increase/decrease of property value due to substitution
  * Appreciation: Increase of value
  * Depreciation: Decrease of value
* Four Stage life cycle

* Balance: Value is created/maintained when there is a balance of different types of real estate (i.e. balance between commercial property and residential property)
* Conformity: Maximum value is achieved when properties are similar
* Contribution: Additional Investment in real estate (typically provides increase in value)
* Increasing/Decreasing Returns: Spending money to improve a property may not equate to an increase in value
  * Over improvement: Too much spent
  * Under improvement:  Too little spent
* Competition: Profit attracts competition
  * Competition leads to supply, which leads to a decrease in value
* Consistent Use: Value of land can't be based on a higher speculative use
* Highest and Best Use: Most optimal use

### Influences on Property Value

Basic forces that influence the value of real estate

* Social Trends
  * Open floor plan
  * Mudroom
* Economic
  * If the economy is doing well then values are up
* Government and legal
  * Taxes, zoning and building

* Environmental and Physical
  * Location, location, location! Think: proximity to transportation and  highways, natural resources, climate, views, etc.
  * location to amenities, major roads, etc

### Depreciation

* Depreciation = loss in value due to aging of a property

  * Accrued Depreciation = already occurred when property purchased

  ...

#### Types of Depreciation

Loss of value can occur due to any of the following:

* Physical Deterioration
  * **Aging**, wear and tear, or neglect of the building
  * Curable
* Functional Obsolescence
  * Poor/Outdated designed or change in building standards
  * Curable
* Economic Obsolescence
  * External factors have a negative impact
  * Incurable
