#### Land Survey Measurements

You might see a number of units of measurement used in the survey. They are:

1 link: 7.92 inches (call it 8 inches for memorization)
1 foot: 12 inches
1 yard: 3 feet
1 rod: **16 feet 6 inches**
1 chain: 66 feet
1 furlong: 660 feet
1 mile: **5,280 feet**
1 acre: 43,560 square feet (1 chain x 1 furlong)
1 square mile: 640 acres  (5280^2=27,878,400/43,560=640)

#### Metes and Bounds

* Metes and Bounds Survey (used in the original 13 colonies)
  * Most common land description
  * Point of beginning and the ending are always the same
  * Lot lines or boundaries of the property are always description

An example metes and bounds survey might read:

> "A plot of land located in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, beginning at the intersection of Canal and Causeway
> Street, running south along Canal Street 304 feet, West to Friend Street 150 feet more or less, North to the intersection of
> Causeway Street and Friend Street, then East along Causeway Street to the intersection of Canal and Causeway Street."

#### Lot and Block

Plat maps are another method of surveying land. They are the recorded plans for a subdivision or municipality, and use the lot and block method. The lot and block method divides the property by streets into blocks, and then subdivides those blocks into lots using the metes and bounds method for each individual lot. The total area of the parcel of land is also described using a metes and bounds survey. 

An example Lot and Block survey might read:

> "Lot 43, Block 17, Green Acre Homes in the City of Portland, according to the plat thereof, recording in Volume 6 of plats, page 84, in Multnomah County, Oregon."
