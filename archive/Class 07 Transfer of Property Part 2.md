## Timeline of Property Transfer

1. Property is listed, then put under agreement via the signing of the P&S
2. Lender hires an attorney or title company to conduct a title search
   * Title search = examination of the chain of title
   * If there are any clouds on title, seller mist fix before closing

4. Seller provides a deed to the buyer transferring ownership of the property
5. Buyers gives the lender a note as evidence of their debt and a mortgage to secure the debt
6. Last minute title search to verify nothing has changed
7. When closing is complete all documents are recorded at the registry of deeds along with the municipal lien certificate

* After recording, seller's attorney pays the listing brokerage
* Listing brokerage pays the buyer's agent's brokerage
* Any recorded documents are duplicated and digitized to provide a public record of transfer
