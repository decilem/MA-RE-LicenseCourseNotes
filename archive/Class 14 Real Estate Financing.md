## Fully Amortized Loans

* Fully Amortized Loans Vocabulary
  * Amortization = payment of debt in equal payments
  * Debt service = PRincipal and Interest
  * Principal = amount borrowed (debt) or loan amount 

* Fully Amortized Loans = loans that are completely paid off when last payment is made
  * Also know as **Direct Reduction Loans**
  * Debt service pays both principal & interest
* PITI Payment
  * Principal
  * Interest
  * Taxes
  * Insurance (home owners insurance)

* How to fully amortized loans work?
  * Every mouth the same payment is made but the amount going towards principal and interest will change and at the last payment the loan is paid off in full
* Amount going toward principal & interest changes over the life of the loan
  * Recalculated monthly
  * Only **12 days** in a calendar year for calculation

* Principal payments are always residual
  * Difference between total payment & interest due
* With each payment made, amount of money going toward principal increases, while the amount going toward interest decreases
  * Final payoff = discharge

## Math using the amortization table

Formula = (loan/1000)* PI = monthly payment

Second month payment 

$374,459.69*0.04 = 14978.39/12 = 1248.20$ (interest)

P&I=1790.31

Interest=1248.20

Amount to principal = 542.11

* Practice time

373,917.57*0.04=14956.70/12=1246.39

Amount to principal = 1790.31-1246.39=543.92

Answer: $373,917.57-543.92=373,373.65$ 

## Fixed vs Adjusted 

* A loan can be either fixed rate or adjustable rate
* Fixed Rate
  * Interest rate doesn't change over the life of the loan
* Adjustable Rate
  * Interest rate is usually lower in the beginning

  * Interest rate adjusts based on prime rate(e.g. prime + 2pts)
  * Payment caps
    * If increase is higher than cap, bank will carry it over to next rate increase
